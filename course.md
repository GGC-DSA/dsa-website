This 3-credit hour Data Science and Analytics Capstone Project (ITEC 4230) course provides practical learning experiences and skills in Data Science and Analytics by engaging in a real-world DSA initiative and applying ideas from the entire DSA curricula to a substantial project of interest in a business, government agency, or other organization. Upon completion of this course students will be able to: (1) Identify and provide a solution to a data-intensive problem in a focus domain; (2) Manage a data analytics life-cycle with large-scale data stores; (3) Apply relevant data processing algorithms; (4) Apply visualization solutions to generate reports and presentations and communicate these in the proper domain language to technical and non-technical stakeholders of project; and (5) Design a data governance solution that considers and satisfies requirements for being secure, ethical, and minimizing risk.
