title: Extreme Weather Prediction - Spring 2022
excerpt: >-
  Our project given to us by our client Tom Coffin was to think on the issue Global Warming and some harmful affects it has on people. Tornados have the ability to be extremely devasting taking human lives and destroying cities. We are going to see if the effects of global warming has any effect on producing more destructive tornados more frequently.

      For our Data Science and Analytics capstone project, we worked with our client Tom Coffin who provided us with a problem statement. Our goal was to find a dataset that represented a potential negative consequence from Global Warming. With this in mind, our team found a dataset that has kept record of tornados that occured in the United States from 1950 to 2015. This set includes details such as F-Scale, width, length, location, injuries, and fatalities.
